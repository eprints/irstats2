IRStats2
========

This is IRStats2 development repository. Please use this space to flag any bugs or requests relating to IRStats2. However if you have any questions as to how to use it, you should do that on the EPrints "ep-tech" mailing-list (you can subscribe here: http://mailman.ecs.soton.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/eprints-tech).

The documentation is hosted here: http://eprints.github.io/irstats2

IRStats2 is now available on the EPrints Bazaar so the "epm" directory above is only retained for legacy purposes. Just note that these "epm" packages are not maintained and are, basically, older versions of the software.

Note that IRStats2 can be run in parallel to the older version aka IRStats. The two packages do not share anything beside the name.
